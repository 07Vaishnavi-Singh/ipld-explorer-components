## Background

This module was extracted from the [IPLD Explorer](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipld-explorer) so it could be reused from the [IPFS Web UI](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-webui).

## Usage

**WARNING: This module is not intended to be re-used in it's current form by other projects.** It's just enough to work with a `create-react-app` set up, as long as you follow the steps below. There is much more work to do to make this a nice set of generic components.

Install it from npm:

```console
npm install ipld-explorer-components
```

The ES5 friendly version of the `src` dir is generated to the `dist` dir. You can
require the React ui components by walking the relevant path into the module:

```js
import CidInfo from `ipld-explorer-components/dist/components/cid-info/CidInfo`
```

There are `peer-dependencies` so that the parent app can pick the versions of common deps. You'll need to add the following deps to your project.

```js
  "prop-types": "^15.6.4",
  "react": "^16.0.0",
  "react-dom": "^16.0.0",
  "redux-bundler": "^21.2.2",
  "redux-bundler-react": "^1.0.1",
  "react-virtualized": "^9.20.0",
  "react-helmet": "^5.2.0",
  "react-loadable": "^5.4.0",
  "tachyons": "^4.11.1",
  "ipfs-css": "^0.9.0"
```

And, assuming you are using `create-react-app` or a similar webpack set up, you'll need the following CSS imports:

```js
import 'tachyons'
import 'ipfs-css'
import 'react-virtualized/styles.css'
import 'ipld-explorer-lib/dist/components/object-info/LinksTable.css'
import 'ipld-explorer-lib/dist/components/loader/Loader.css'
```
